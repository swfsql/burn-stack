/// A single Pre-LN block wrapper computing `M(RMSNorm(x))` — the residual is
/// **not** applied here. The enclosing [`Layers`] owns
/// that decision (add the input back, suppress it on the first/last layer, or
/// thread it through Multi-Gate streams), so no input clone / zero-add is wasted
/// when no residual is wanted.
///
/// With [`Self::mlp`] set the layer additionally runs a second Pre-LN sub-block,
/// a SwiGLU feed-forward (see [`GatedMlp`]). It
/// has a residual of its own, *inside* the layer, which is the reason the
/// methods below return the layer's **total delta** rather than the mixer output:
///
/// ```text
///   h₁ = M(norm(x))                     the mixer sub-block
///   h₂ = mlp(norm2(x + h₁))             the feed-forward sub-block
///   return h₁ + h₂                      so that Layers' `x + delta` is
///                                       (x + h₁) + h₂ — both residuals
/// ```
///
/// Folding it this way keeps [`Layers`] the single owner of the *outer* residual
/// (and of the `ignore_first/last_residual` ablations, which therefore govern
/// only that outer add — the feed-forward's inner residual is intrinsic to the
/// sub-block and always applies). Without an `mlp` the delta is just `h₁` and
/// nothing changes for a block family that carries no feed-forward.
///
/// May carry its own [`ClassLatent`]s, placed from a [`ClassCursor`]: `step`
/// splices them around the token it is given, while in `forward` the caller
/// splices them first (via [`Self::insert_latents`]) so the residual it adds
/// sees the same lengthened sequence; [`Self::prime`] steps the ones waiting for
/// the next token *without* that token. They are independent of any class
/// latents on the enclosing [`Layers`].
