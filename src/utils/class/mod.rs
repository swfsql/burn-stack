// ===========================================================================
// Class tokens / latents (learnable sequence-inserted tokens)
// ===========================================================================
//
// A *class token* / *class latent* is a learnable embedding spliced into the
// sequence — a transformer-`[CLS]`-style register the model can read/write
// through. They are inserted at the input boundary of a container (a network's
// input for [`ClassToken`], width = the input feature width; a layer's working
// sequence for [`ClassLatent`], width = `d_model`), permanently lengthening the
// sequence for everything downstream. A container can carry any number; the
// markers below say *where* each one lands, while a single `Param<Tensor<2>>`
// of shape `[num_markers, width]` holds the embeddings (row `i` ↔ marker `i`).
//
// Insertion order (all relative to the *original* length `L`): every `Start`
// first (index 0), then `Middle` (index `L/2`, splitting the original
// sequence), then `End` (index `L`), then `Custom(index)` (explicit index,
// inserted last). Markers sharing an index keep their `Vec` order.
//
// One rule places three of the four kinds: the marker names an index into the
// *original* sequence and is emitted immediately **before** the user token
// sitting there — `Start` (0) opens the sequence, `Middle` (`L/2`) splits it,
// `Custom(k)` precedes token `k`. `End` is the sole exception, having no token
// to precede: it **closes** the sequence, trailing the last user token.
//
// `Custom` is uniform in `k`, so a `Custom(k ≥ L)` simply never lands — there is
// no token `k` to precede. Should the caller keep feeding tokens past the
// announced `L`, it lands then, still *before* the next token; it never trails.
// An open-ended stream (no hint) is likewise never closed — the same reason
// `End` needs the length hint below.
//
// `step` therefore returns the output of the **last** token it emitted (and
// leaves the state after it): the user token, unless `End` follows it — `End`
// being then the sequence's latest token. Markers emitted before the user token
// only leave their mark on the state.
//
// `prime` is the call that reads *those* back. It emits the markers waiting for
// the next user token — without one, so it needs no input data — and returns the
// last of them (`None` when none were waiting). Being exactly `step`'s opening
// half, `prime` followed by `step` emits what that `step` alone would have, in
// the same order: seedless generation is `prime` → sample → `step` → sample → …
// `End` is never primed — it *closes* the sequence, so it belongs to the call
// carrying the last user token, which is why it is the one marker `step` (and
// `forward`) already hands back.
//
// Placement is **streamed**, identically for `forward` (a chunk of the
// sequence) and `step` (a single token): [`ClassCursors`] carries one
// `full_len` hint — the length of the whole sequence the call is part of — plus
// one cursor per level, each recording how much of *that* level's output
// sequence earlier calls already emitted. From those:
//
//   * a marker whose output position is behind the cursor was emitted by an
//     earlier call and is skipped — so `Start` fires only while the cursor is
//     still at 0, and a resumed stream does not re-insert it;
//   * `Middle`/`End` resolve only against the whole sequence, so they **panic**
//     without a `full_len` hint (`Start`/`Custom` are length-independent and
//     work on an open-ended stream);
//   * a marker landing exactly at a chunk's end is emitted by that chunk only
//     if the chunk *closes* the sequence — otherwise it opens the next one, so
//     splitting a sequence anywhere leaves the placement unchanged.
//
// No cursors (`None`) keeps the two calls' historical defaults: `forward` treats
// its argument as the whole sequence (`full_len` = its length, cursors at 0),
// `step` injects nothing at all.
