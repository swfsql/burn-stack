//! Detaching a module's parameters from the autodiff graph.
//!
//! Cuts gradient flow through a module. **This does not save memory** — see the
//! warning below; [`Layers::grad_horizon`](crate::modules::Layers::grad_horizon)
//! moves its no-grad prefix to the inner backend instead.
//!
//! # Why detaching the *activations* is not enough
//!
//! Burn tracks gradients **per tensor**, not ambiently: there is no
//! `torch.no_grad()`. An op is untracked only when *every* input node has
//! `Requirement::None`, so `layer.forward(x.detach())` still builds a full graph
//! — the layer's own weights are tracked `Param`s, and one tracked input is
//! enough. Untracked ops, by contrast, are registered with **unit state**, so no
//! activation is retained: that is where the memory saving comes from.
//!
//! Cutting gradient flow through a prefix therefore takes *both* halves:
//! [`detach_params`] on a **clone** of the module (the original keeps its
//! tracked params, which is what lets a weight-shared layer receive gradient
//! from its tracked applications only), and `.detach()` on every tensor entering
//! the prefix from outside.
//!
//! # Warning: this frees no memory
//!
//! An untracked op is still **registered in the graph** — Burn keeps an
//! `UntrackedOpsStep` per op so that a memory-bound op with an untracked parent
//! can still retrieve it — so its output stays retained. Measured on a
//! 64-virtual-layer `Layers` of an SSM block (flex, `d_model` 128, batch 4,
//! seq 512),
//! peak RSS with a 2-layer gradient horizon was 3144 MB with a detached prefix
//! against 208 MB with an inner-backend one, and only the latter is flat in
//! depth. Detaching buys the gradient semantics and essentially none of the
//! memory.
//!
//! # What this does *not* reach
//!
//! [`Module::map`](burn::module::Module::map) is a **no-op on plain `Tensor` fields** — Burn implements
//! `Module for Tensor` as a constant (`map` returns `self`), so only
//! [`Param`](burn::module::Param)-wrapped tensors go through the mapper. Weights
//! are `Param`s and are covered; bare tensors (notably the caches) are not.
