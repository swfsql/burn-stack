//! Column layout of the fused projection weights — the data the Muon parameter
//! groups are built from.
//!
//! Every family fuses several independent linear maps into one `Linear`, so a
//! block's weight tensor is a *concatenation* of matrices along its output
//! (column) axis. Muon orthogonalises a whole matrix at once, so it must be told
//! where those seams are; a [`ProjSpec`] is that description, and each family's
//! [`BlockConfig::muon_projections`](crate::modules::BlockConfig::muon_projections)
//! builds one per fused weight, right next to the code that sizes them.
