//! Muon support: which weights the optimizer may touch, and how the fused
//! projections are split before it sees them.
//!
//! [Muon](burn::optim::Muon) replaces a 2-D weight's momentum update with the
//! nearest orthogonal matrix (Newton–Schulz). That only makes sense for a
//! parameter that *is* one linear map, which rules out three things in this
//! crate:
//!
//! 1. **Rank ≠ 2.** Burn's `Muon::step` asserts `D == 2`, so biases, norm gains,
//!    a block's per-head scalars, a depthwise conv weight, and every 3-D
//!    tensor must stay on the fallback optimizer. Passing one to Muon
//!    panics — which is why the plan built here is an **allowlist**: only the
//!    weights named by a [`ProjSpec`] are moved off AdamW.
//! 2. **Embedding-like matrices.** The token embedding, the LM head, the
//!    `LatentNetwork` input/output projections and the class-token/latent tables
//!    are rank-2 but are lookup/readout tables at the model boundary; the usual
//!    Muon recipe keeps them on AdamW. They are simply never listed.
//! 3. **Fused projections.** Every family concatenates several independent maps
//!    into one `Linear` (`in_proj` most of all). Orthogonalising that
//!    concatenation ties together maps that share nothing but an allocation, so
//!    the plan carries the column seams and [`Segmented`] applies Muon
//!    **per block**. The model is untouched — the forward pass keeps its single
//!    fused GEMM.
//!
//! Within a fused projection one more distinction applies: blocks that emit
//! *per-head scalars* (a step size, a decay rate) are gains rather than feature
//! maps and stay on AdamW ([`ProjSegment::adamw`]).
//!
//! ## Why 3-D tensors are never "stacked matrices"
//!
//! A `[heads, r, dim]` tensor looks like a stack of matrices a stack-aware Muon
//! could take a slice at a time. In practice it almost never is one: the shapes
//! that show up at rank 3 in a mixer block are per-head *diagonals* (a learnable
//! gain vector broadcast over a projection's output), a bias, an initial
//! condition, or a depthwise filter — orthogonalising any of them would
//! constrain a set of gains rather than a linear map. Whichever part of a block
//! really is an R-fold matrix expansion lives in a fused 2-D projection, and is
//! reachable through a [`ProjSpec`] segment. So the rule stays simple: rank 2,
//! named explicitly, or AdamW.
//!
//! The seams a [`ProjSpec`] carries are therefore **per named sub-projection**,
//! not per head/group/MIMO rank — the same boundaries the forward's
//! `split_into` uses, and the usual Muon convention (a transformer's `W_q` goes
//! to Muon with all heads fused). A caller who wants to test a finer split can
//! just hand [`ProjSpec::block`] more segments.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let plan = model_config.muon_plan();
//! let mut optim = plan.build(&adamw_config, &muon_config);
//! // ... then the usual `optim.step(lr, model, grads)`.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Learning rate
//!
//! Muon and AdamW share the one learning rate `optim.step` is called with.
//! [`AdjustLrFn::MatchRmsAdamW`] rescales
//! Muon's update so its per-element RMS is `0.2·lr` — AdamW's own ballpark — so
//! an LR schedule tuned for AdamW can be reused as-is. That is what
//! [`muon_config`] returns; the default
//! [`AdjustLrFn::Original`] instead expects a Muon-specific
//! (typically much larger) LR.
